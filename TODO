Following are the list which I plan to implement in the future:

	- make the output texts colorful, the important content can thus be highlighted
	- adjust the danmaku's format in xml2ass, and delete the special characters in xml files automatically before the conversion
	- build a danmaku's filter
	- a script that can download all chinese online videos that shuoshu supports
	- when the error of "invalid header range" is occurred the script will return the message and stop downloading, all the downloaded parts are deleted automatically
	- update danmaku in xml files
