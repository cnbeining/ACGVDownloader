This is the bash scripts used for downloading videos from Chinese online video resources, such as tudou, youku, etc. It uses the parse address from Shuoshu, I did it so as to save my time to finish these codes...
I will add more features in the future, but everything depends on whether I still have time to do it...

Need the following packages:
aria2 - A highly advanced command line downloader which I use it to download multiple clips from the video address, it can do parallel downloading and thus make it much faster.
mencoder - Used to merge the splitted clips together.
etc - I don't know if there are any other packages missing, please let me know if you meet the problems for that.

Two python packages required:
python request
python aeidon

The python script xml2ass is used to convert the xml danmaku into ass substitle files. I copied it from this repo: https://github.com/muzuiget/standalone-scripts/tree/master/python, many thanks to him. If there is any problem for the copying please let me informed so that I can remove it immediately....
